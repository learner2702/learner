I want to know the Tcl script required for calculation of standard deviation of a column from a file using "expr" function. Suppose I have a input file named "input.dat" which contains the following data:  6 7  5 6  3 8  9 2  And I want to calculate the the standard deviation of "Column 2" only using the "expr" function of Tcl, so what will be the Tcl script for doing the calculation. I am very much new in this Tcl scripting, can anybody please help me with the Tcl script ?
